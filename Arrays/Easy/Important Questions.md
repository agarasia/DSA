2. Find the union
3. Longest subarray of Sum K (positive numbers)
4. Longest subarray of Sum K (positive and negative numbers)

## Approaches to remember for each question

### Move Zeros to end
1.  First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
2.  After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
3.  While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
    1.  **If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element:** We will swap a[i] and a[j]. Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i]. So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
4.  Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.

### Find the union
Use Set data structure or a map data structure.

### Longest subarray of Sum K (positive numbers)

First, check brute-force (find all possible subarrays and find the longest)
Optimal algorithm:
1.  First, we will take two pointers: left and right, initially pointing to the index 0.
2.  The sum is set to a[0] i.e. the first element initially.
3.  Now we will run a while loop until the right pointer crosses the last index i.e. n-1.
4.  Inside the loop, we will do the following:
    1.  We will use another while loop and it will run until the sum is lesser or equal to k.
        1.  Inside this second loop, from the sum, we will subtract the element that is pointed by the left pointer and increase the left pointer by 1.
    2.  After this loop gets completed, we will check if the sum is equal to k. If it is, we will compare the length of the current subarray i.e. (right-left+1) with the existing one and consider the maximum one.
    3.  Then we will move forward the right pointer by 1. If the right pointer is pointing to a valid index(< n) after the increment, we will add the element i.e. a[right] to the sum.
5.  Finally, we will return the maximum length.


#### Note: Time complexity is still O(n). HOW?
##### The second loop is not running for n times for all n elements.


### Longest subarray of Sum K (Positive and Negative numbers)

First, TRY brute-force (find all possible subarrays and find the longest)
Then, steps for optimal approach are as follows:

1.  First, we will declare a map to store the prefix sums and the indices.
2.  Then we will run a loop(say i) from index 0 to n-1(n = size of the array).
3.  For each index i, we will do the following:
    1.  We will add the current element i.e. a[i] to the prefix sum.
    2.  If the sum is equal to k, we should consider the length of the current subarray i.e. i+1. We will compare this length with the existing length and consider the maximum one.
    3.  We will calculate the prefix sum i.e. x-k, of the remaining subarray.
    4.  If that sum of the remaining part i.e. x-k exists in the map, we will calculate the length i.e. i-preSumMap[x-k], and consider the maximum one comparing it with the existing length we have achieved until now.
    5.  If the sum, we got after step 3.1, does not exist in the map we will add that with the current index into the map. We are checking the map before insertion because we want the index to be as minimum as possible and so we will consider the earliest index where the sum x-k has occurred.
